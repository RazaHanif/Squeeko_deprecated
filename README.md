## Coming <s>Soon</s>Never

Turns out self hosting AI models is really expensive.
The python backend has my fully built out self hosted logic, but I underestimated the GPU usage to run the models. 
I started on the API hosted version of the product, but lowkey self hosting it was 75% of the appeal for me, and I kinda lost intrest.
